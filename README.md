# Portfolio Website

The source code for my portfolio website, which can be found at [LevinLeesemann.com](https://levinleesemann.com/)

Built from scratch with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in TypeScript to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The page is hosted via [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with local development done using [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

## Key Features

- **Responsive & Modern UI**: Built to look great on phones, tablets, and desktops with smooth interactions and layout consistency
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Seamless theme switching with user preference support and improved UX
- **Multi-Language Support**: Fully localized interface in English and German, making the site accessible to broader audiences
- **Fast Development & Build**: Leveraging Vite’s instant server start and optimized production builds for performance
